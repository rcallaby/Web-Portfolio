# Web Portfolio Websites and Templates

## Created by Richard Callaby

Follow me on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/rcallaby) to see what projects or tutorials I am currently working on!  

The purpose of this repository is to fit some of my portfolio websites (showcase websites) that wouldn't fit anywhere else. For instance, I may use some templates and this is where my HTML website templates would reside. Many of these websites should be responsive by design, however, some may not be and I will point out which templates are responsive and which templates are not.

Not only am I a software developer but I am also a [published Kindle author](http://amazon.com/author/richardcallaby
) as well as an [Udemy Instructor](https://www.udemy.com/user/richardcallaby/).

I have numerous interests besides software development, but obviously, my software projects will be showcased on GitHub for all to enjoy!
